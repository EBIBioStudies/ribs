RIBS (REST-based Interface for BioStudies) is a RESTful API interface for interacting with the [BioStudies database](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies), EMBL-EBI's comprehensive repository for biological study data and metadata.

## About BioStudies

BioStudies is an EBI resource that holds descriptions of biological studies, links to supporting data in other databases, and archives data files that do not fit in existing public structured archives. The database organizes data from biological studies, typically associated with publications, offering a simple way to describe study structure.

## Features

- **RESTful API Access**: Programmatic access to BioStudies database functionality
- **Study Management**: Create, update, and retrieve biological study metadata
- **File Operations**: Handle study-associated files and datasets
- **Search Capabilities**: Query and search through study submissions
- **Authentication**: Secure access control for data submission and modification

## API Endpoints

The RIBS interface provides access to key BioStudies operations including:

- **Security & Authentication**: User authentication and session management
- **File Management**: Upload, download, and manage study files
- **Submissions**: Create and modify study submissions
- **Search**: Query and retrieve study information

For detailed API documentation, visit the [BioStudies API Documentation](https://biostudies.gitbook.io/biostudies-api).
